<p>
Articles are loaded from the <em>src</em> directory, starting with "index.xml",
and recursing through any sub-articles specified in any &lt;subs&gt; sections.
In addition to this, chronological-style articles are loaded from files named
"article.xml", in directories under "src/articles". These directories should
be named in the form "YYYYMMDDhhmmss" (Years, Months, Days, hours, minutes, 
seconds) - the date and time associated with the article.
</p>

<p>
The articles are stored as WMG::article objects, and may be accessed through 
the site object's {INDEX} member, which specifies the index page. Any sub-page
may be accessed through this. Chronological articles are stored by a 
WMG::weblog object, stored as the site's {BLOG} member, which allows additional
control over the chronological articles (e.g. picking articles between certain
dates).
