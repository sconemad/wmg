<p>
A file called "sitedef" in the site's root directory specifies global 
configuration settings for the site. This basically consisits of perl commands
which are evaluated by <strong>wmg</strong> before processing the articles.
The <em>$site</em> hash-ref should be used to store any global configuration 
settings, which can then be accessed later on. The following is a list of 
standard settings used by <strong>wmg</strong>, though you are free to add 
anything else for your own use:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  {title} - The site's title, included by default in the &lt;title&gt; section,
  and at the top of each page.
  </li>
  <li>
  {author} - The username of the site's author.
  </li>
  <li>
  {base} - The site's base URL when published (e.g. "http://www.blah.com").
  </li>
  <li>
  {copyright} - Copyright notice for site, included by default at the foot of
  each page.
  </li>
  <li>
  {editor} - Email address of the site's editor.
  </li>
  <li> 
  {webmaster} - Email address of the site's webmaster, included by default at
  the foot of each page.
  </li>
  <li>
  {description} - A brief description of the site, included by default in RSS
  feeds.
  </li>
  <li>
  {HEAD} - Additional headers to insert in the &lt;head&gt; section of XHTML
  files. Here you can add links to stylesheets, alternative versions 
  (e.g. RSS feeds), "Favourites" icons, metadata, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
  {NEWS} - XHTML formatted news from WMG::news::make_news(). Use to include
